Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n3. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n4. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n5. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n6. The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\n7. Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\n8. At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down.

Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart.  Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.

Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position.  The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move.  The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n4.

For this exercise you will need to get into a pushup position, but instead of having your hands of the floor, you will be grabbing on to an Olympic barbell (loaded with 5-10 lbs on each side) instead.  This will be your starting position.\n2. While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times.  Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement.  If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.\n3. After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale.\n4. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n",

Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance.  Inhale as you go down.

Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n5.

The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward.  In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions.  Then you switch legs and do the same.\n8. A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion.  For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead.  This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.\n",

The correct height should be anywhere above the waist but below the chest. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, lock your hands together and place the bar on top of your arms in between the forearm and upper arm.\n2. Lift the bar up so that it is resting on top of your forearms.  If you are holding the bar properly, it should look as if you have your arms crossed but with a bar running across them.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4. Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor).  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.

Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n2. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out.  Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back.  This will be your starting position.  (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n4. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up.  Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes.  Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.  Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front.  If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.
